                <h2>World War II: A Global Conflict</h2>
                World War II, the most extensive and deadliest conflict in human history, reshaped the world in ways
                that are still felt today. It was a war that involved more than 50 nations and was fought on land, sea,
                and air across the globe. On this website, we aim to provide a concise, but detailed summary of the main 
                events of the war. On here, you'll find photos and videos, as well as a timeline of events.

                    <h3>The Prelude to War</h3>
                    <p>
                        The seeds of World War Two were planted in the aftermath of World War One. 
                        Political and economic instability in Germany paved the way for Adolf Hitler
                        and the National Socialist German Workers' Party, more commonly known as the 
                        Nazi Party, to take power. With their promises and plans for economic 
                        reformation, the ideation of the Aryan super race and a view of the empire of
                        Third Reich, Adolf Hitler's party coming into power was nearly inevitable.

                    <h3>Kristallnacht: The Night of Broken Glass</h3>
                    <p>Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, occurred on November 9-10, 1938.
                        It was a state-sponsored program against the Jewish community in Nazi Germany.
                        Synagogues were burned, Jewish-owned businesses were destroyed, and many Jews
                        were arrested and sent to concentration camps. This event signaled a shift
                        from discriminatory policies to violent, aggressive actions against Jews
                        and was a prelude to the atrocities of the Holocaust.</p>

                    <h3>The Outbreak</h3>
                    <p>The war began with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939.
                        This act of aggression prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany,
                        marking the beginning of a six-year battle that would engulf the world.</p>

                    <h3>The Holocaust</h3>
                    <p>One of the darkest chapters of World War II was the Holocaust, the systematic
                        extermination of six million Jews by the Nazi regime. It stands as a stark
                        reminder of the horrors of genocide and the consequences of unchecked hatred and bigotry.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Key Events</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>The Battle of Stalingrad</em> was a turning point on the Eastern
                            Front, with Soviet forces defeating the German Army.</li>
                        <li>The Allied invasion of Normandy, known as <em>D-Day</em>
                            on June 6, 1944, marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.</li>
                        <li>The bombing of <em>Hiroshima and Nagasaki</em> with the atomic
                            bomb by the United States led to Japan's surrender and the end of the war.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
                    <p>The war ended with the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers.
                        The world was left to grapple with the immense human and material
                        cost of the war and the task of rebuilding. The United Nations was
                        established in the hope of preventing future conflicts on such a scale.</p>
