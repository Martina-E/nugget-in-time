                <h3>The Prelude to War</h3>
                <p>
                    World War II, the most extensive and deadliest conflict in human history,
                    reshaped the world in ways that are still felt today. It was a war that
                    involved more than 50 nations and was fought on land, sea, and air across
                    the globe.
                </p>
                <h3>Kristallnacht: The Night of Broken Glass</h3>
                <p>Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, occurred on November 9-10, 1938.
                    It was a state-sponsored program against the Jewish community in Nazi Germany.
                    Synagogues were burned, Jewish-owned businesses were destroyed, and many Jews
                    were arrested and sent to concentration camps. This event signaled a shift
                    from discriminatory policies to violent, aggressive actions against Jews
                    and was a prelude to the atrocities of the Holocaust.</p>
                <h3>The Outbreak</h3>
                <p>The war began with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939.
                    This act of aggression prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany,
                    marking the beginning of a six-year battle that would engulf the world.</p>
                <h3>The Holocaust</h3>
                <p>One of the darkest chapters of World War II was the Holocaust, the systematic
                    extermination of six million Jews by the Nazi regime. It stands as a stark
                    reminder of the horrors of genocide and the consequences of unchecked hatred and bigotry.</p>
                <h3>Key Events</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The Battle of Stalingrad</em> was a turning point on the Eastern
                        Front, with Soviet forces defeating the German Army.</li>
                    <li>The Allied invasion of Normandy, known as <em>D-Day</em>
                        on June 6, 1944, marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.</li>
                    <li>The bombing of <em>Hiroshima and Nagasaki</em> with the atomic
                        bomb by the United States led to Japan's surrender and the end of the war.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
                <p>The war ended with the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers.
                    The world was left to grapple with the immense human and material
                    cost of the war and the task of rebuilding. The United Nations was
                    established in the hope of preventing future conflicts on such a scale.</p>

                <h3>The Prelude to War</h3>
                <p>
                    The seeds of World War II were sown in the aftermath of World War I.
                    Political and economic instability, particularly in Germany, along with the rise of fascism,
                    set the stage for a second, even more devastating conflict.
