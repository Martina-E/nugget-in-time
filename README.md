# Nugget in Time - WW2

[View the live project here](https://martina-e.github.io/nugget-in-time/index.html)

## Introduction
Nugget in Time is a historical education site that aims to explain various historical events in a simple, and easy-to-read manner. This specific site is based around the events of World War Two. The site will be targeted towards causal historians and students who want a simple summary of the events of World War Two. 

This project was made as the first of five milestone portfolio projects required to complete the Diploma in Software Development program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of the project are to create a responsive and static front-end site, with no less than three pages, to provide useful information to users, using HTML5 and CSS3.

## UX 
The ideal users for this website are:
- New user
- Current user 
- History students

### Current user goals
1. As a current user, I want to be able to easily navigate the website and access the information that I require easily. 
2. As a current user, I want to easily navigate back to content that I have already viewed in as few steps as possible. 
3. As a current user, I want to see any new updates to the gallery, as the site developer adds more to the site. 

### New user goals
1. As a new user, I want to navigate the site easily and intuitively. 
2. As a new user, I want the information that I need to be easily accesible and easy to understand. 
3. As a new user, I want colour schemes and relevant visuals that work with the content. 

### History student goals
1. As a history student, I want information that is historically accurate and correct.
2. As a history student, I want the information that I need to be easily accesible and easy to understand. 
3. As a history student, I want the images and videos to be relevant to the information on the site. 

## Design
### Typography
The typography used on the site are [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab) for the headers and titles, and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) for the bodies of text imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Respective backups for Serif and Sans-serif was applied in the case of a failure with the import. 

### Images
The imagery was sourced from the directories of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

## Features
- The title of the website, as well as a tagline, is featured at the top of the window on every page. 
- Each page features an intro, highlighting what the page is for and it's relevance to the site. 
- The footer appears at the bottom of every page, and features icons that open links to the associated social media websites in new tabs. 
- The same colours have been used throughout the wesbite, in keeping with the theme.

*Navigation Bar*
+ The navigation bar is present at the top of all pages, below the header, with direct links to each page. The header above the navigation bar acts as a link back to the homepage. It is identical on each page to allow for easy, intuitive navigation. 
+ This wil allow the user to navigate between pages without having to go to go back to the previous page using the browser's 'Back' button.
+ Along with the header, the navigation bar streches along the screen, but resizes accoedingly on smaller screens.

### *Gallery*
This page features a series of photos that, on a smaller screen, they appear stacked on top of one another. On larger screens, the pictures appear in two columns. 

### *Feedback*
This apge features a feedback form that encourages users to submit any feedback that they have on the website. It collects the user's name and email address, and provides an expandable space for them to write and submit their feedback. 

## Features left to implement
- A page with a form where users can submit their own pictures for review by the site owners. Selected photos will be uploaded to the gallery with acknowledgements. 

## Issues and Bugs

There was an ongoing issue with the formatting of the navigation bar and the footer, but this was amended using tutor support.

- CSS
No issues were found when passed through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

- Accesibilty
