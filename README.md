[View the live project here](https://martina-e.github.io/nugget-in-time/index.html)

## Introduction
Nuggets in Time is a historical education site that aims to explain various historical events in a simple, and easy-to-read manner. This specific site is based around the events of World War Two. The site will be targeted towards causal historians and students who want a simple summary of the events of World War Two. 

This project was made as the first of five milestone portfolio projects required to complete the Diploma in Software Development program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of the project are to create a responsive and static front-end site, with no less than three pages, to provide useful information to users, using HTML5 and CSS3. 

## UX 
The ideal users for this website are:
- New user
- Current user 
- History students

### Current user goals
1. As a current user, I want to be able to easily navigate the website and access the information that I require easily. 
2. As a current user, I want to easily navigate back to content that I have already viewed in as few steps as possible. 
3. As a current user, I want to see any new updates to the gallery, as the site developer adds more to the site. 

### New user goals
1. As a new user, I want to navigate the site easily and intuitively. 
2. As a new user, I want the information that I need to be easily accesible and easy to understand. 
3. As a new user, I want colour schemes and relevant visuals that work with the content. 

### History student goals
1. As a history student, I want information that is historically accurate and correct.
2. As a history student, I want the information that I need to be easily accesible and easy to understand. 
3. As a history student, I want the images and videos to be relevant to the information on the site. 

## Development planes

## Design
### Typography
The typography used on the site are [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab) for the headers and titles, and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) for the bodies of text imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Respective backups for Serif and Sans-serif was applied in the case of a failure with the import.

## Features
**Navigation Bar
+ The navigation bar is present at the top of all pages, below the header, with direct links to each page. The header above the navigation bar acts as a link back to the homepage. It is identical on each page to allow for easy, intuitive navigation. 
+ This wil allow the user to navigate between pages without having to go to go back to the previous page using the browser's 'Back' button.

*Home page*
- The title of the website, as well as a tagline, is featured at the top of the window on every page.
